# map_fosh_demand

Hi there, thanks for passing by! This repo is the rallying point for the map_fosh_demand project. 

#### Short explanation:
In a few words, we want to use online surveys to try and figure out what kind of equipment researchers/Bio DIYers/citzen scientists need to do their work and what they currently lack/need.

#### The long Story:
Science and Education are driving forces for development and prosperity, and therefore should be accessible to everyone, so that people can improve their lives, their environments and communities. Unfortunately, the cost of research equipment used in S&E is quite high and even simple plastic trays cost ~100€ [link to example].  


#### Who are we:
This project is part of my year as a Mozilla fellow, but it has been long in the making, during chats, discussions and workshops with amazing groups/people around the world. Special mention to Trend in Africa, Open Neuroscience, GOSH community, the Mozilla Foundation, the University of Sussex and Rede de Pesquisadores. (add links/logos).

##### Pilot run:
Together with Rede de Pesquisadores, a preliminary test survey was conducted in Brazilian Portuguese. We gathered ~90 responses which are available here [add location] as a .tsv file. We've also processed the data
