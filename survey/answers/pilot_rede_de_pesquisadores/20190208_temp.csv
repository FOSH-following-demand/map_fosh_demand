Male,,St Louis,MO,USA,neuroscience,PhD,,Yes,"Washington University, OpenBehavior.org",Professor,Other,Neuroscience,18,Partially satisfactory,,"Our group focuses on behavioral neuroscience, and in particular feeding and obesity.  I have often seen a bottle-neck in equipment, in that commercial equipment for measuring feeding and metabolism is both expensive and takes up a lot of space.  So if we want to buy a commercial system for measuring food intake, we will pay about $5K per set-up (for each mouse we can run at one time), and we will need a special place to house it.  As a result of these two factors, most people studying feeding purchase systems of ~8-16 setups, at a cost of $40-80K.  Very few groups could afford more than this for equipment, and even if we did purchase 30 setups we'd need an extra room to house them in, which is hard to come by.  The problem with using 8-16 chambers is that feeding (like many other complex behaviors) is very variable between mice.  The norm in our field is ~8 mice/group, which I believe is linked to the availability of commercial equipment.  In the research groups I've been a part of that's been my experience. 
 However, when statistical power is calculated on feeding studies we are often woefully underpowered.  Ideally we would look at ~100 mice per group, but that's simply not an option.  So in that way, I find our equipment unsatisfactory, and my entry into the open source hardware community was the result of me trying to overcome this bottleneck.  On the other hand, much of our equipment is excellent and I am grateful to be able to be able to use it - this includes microscopes and ephys equipment.
