 however, when statistical power is calculated on feeding studies we are often woefully underpowered.  ideally we would look at ~100 mice per group, but that's simply not an option.  so in that way, i find our equipment unsatisfactory, and my entry into the open source hardware community was the result of me trying to overcome this bottleneck.  on the other hand, much of our equipment is excellent and i am grateful to be able to be able to use it - this includes microscopes and ephys equipment.  a lot of engineering went into these systems and i think they are excellent (although expensive) products."	too many users for a small number of equipment/tools	behavioral monitoring equipment	electrophysiology equipment	microscopy	electrophysiology rig	laser uncaging system for electrophysiology rig	none	yes	we usually design the power of our studies around available equipment and person-hours... i hate to say it but this becomes the decision-maker on group size more than statistical concerns	equipment unavailable (other reasons than being broken)	yes	python, bonsai, imagej, 	yes	imagej, python, bonsai	yes	fed, a lot of home-brew equipment 	yes	i am not strongly tied to the brands we use, so if something came out that was a better fit for our research i'd definitely consider it!	yes	our lab has a lot of experience designing and building open-source behavioral equipment (https://hackaday.io/projects/hacker/294140) so i'm comfortable building others' projects.	yes	just to try out new things	yes	we have built many devices for monitoring animal behavior (https://hackaday.io/projects/hacker/294140).  this effort in our lab started as a result of limited equipment for our experiments, and the inability to purchase more due to price and space limits.  	yes					959.69	18.5					31.3					22.51				597.94									95.01							171.89										13.28			9.26
