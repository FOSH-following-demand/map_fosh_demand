I have often seen a bottle-neck in equipment, in that commercial equipment for measuring feeding and metabolism is both expensive and takes up a lot of space.  So if we want to buy a commercial system for measuring food intake, we will pay about $5K per set-up (for each mouse we can run at one time), and we will need a special place to house it.  As a result of these two factors, most people studying feeding purchase systems of ~8-16 setups, at a cost of $40-80K.  Very few groups could afford more than this for equipment, and even if we did purchase 30 setups we'd need an extra room to house them in, which is hard to come by.  The problem with using 8-16 chambers is that feeding (like many other complex behaviors) is very variable between mice.  The norm in our field is ~8 mice/group, which I believe is linked to the availability of commercial equipment.  In the research groups I've been a part of that's been my experience. 
 However, when statistical power is calculated on feeding studies we are often woefully underpowered.  Ideally we would look at ~100 mice per group, but that's simply not an option.  So in that way, I find our equipment unsatisfactory, and my entry into the open source hardware community was the result of me trying to overcome this bottleneck.  On the other hand, much of our equipment is excellent and I am grateful to be able to be able to use it - this includes microscopes and ephys equipment.  A lot of engineering went into these systems and I think they are excellent (although expensive) products."

Yes	Just to try out new things	Yes	We have built many devices for monitoring animal behavior (https://hackaday.io/projects/hacker/294140).

Yes	We often have to make field equipment ourselves using whatever we can buy in a hardware store, because it simply is not possible to buy the items locally and the cost of shipping larger items is often more expensive than the item itself. I would consider building equipment if the components were readily available locally - bearing in mind that, often, things considered commonplace in larger countries are not available on small, remote islands! I would definitely consider building something from a kit, even if a few things had to be purchased separately. For example, a compact, easily shipped kit containing the instructions and any hard to find components, that would be supplemented by bulky but inexpensive items that are available from the hardware store.
